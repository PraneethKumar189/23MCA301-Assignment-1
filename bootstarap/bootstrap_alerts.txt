Bootstrap Alerts Guide
=====================

Bootstrap alerts are contextual feedback messages that provide important information, success messages, warnings, or errors to users. They offer a consistent and visually appealing way to display notifications in web applications.

1. Alert Types (Contextual Classes)
---------------------------------
* alert-primary: Blue (primary information)
* alert-secondary: Gray (secondary information)
* alert-success: Green (success messages)
* alert-danger: Red (error messages)
* alert-warning: Yellow (warning messages)
* alert-info: Light blue (informational messages)
* alert-light: Light gray
* alert-dark: Dark gray

2. Alert Components
-----------------
a) Basic Alert
- Simple message with background color
- Basic structure:
    <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    This is a primary alert!
    </div>

b) Dismissible Alert
- Includes a close button
- Requires additional classes and button element:
    <div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
    Warning! You should check this out.
    <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>

c) Alert with Links
- Can contain clickable links
- Example:
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    Info with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>.
    </div>

3. Making Alerts Dismissible
--------------------------
Requirements:
1. Add 'alert-dismissible' class
2. Add 'fade' and 'show' classes for animation
3. Include a close button with 'data-bs-dismiss="alert"'
4. Include Bootstrap's JavaScript bundle

4. JavaScript Integration
----------------------
- Alerts can be dynamically created, modified, or removed using JavaScript
- Supported events:
* close.bs.alert: Fired immediately when close instance method is called
* closed.bs.alert: Fired when alert has been closed

Note: For proper functionality, ensure that both Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files are properly included in your project.
